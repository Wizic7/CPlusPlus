            "It Was The Homes": "It really is a shame about the bear. It was almost certainly the Homes family that is responsible. I really am famished but there is no way we could possibly eat with this tragedy in our house. Have you talked to Harriet? She would be so glad to see you!",
            "You Are Right": "What! It was The Butler???",

            "It Was The Home": "Of course, it was the Homes family! They've always been envious of our success. This tragedy is just another one of their schemes.",
            "You Are Right": "I knew it! The Butler has always been suspicious. We should have never trusted him.",
            "You Are Wrong": "How could you even suggest that? The Homes are behind this, I am certain!",
            "General Dialogue": "This house has stood for generations, and I will not let the Homes tarnish our legacy. We must stand strong together."

            "It Was The Home": "It is a shame that I didn't catch the Home gang in the act. They wouldn't have made it out alive.",
            "You Are Right": "Well of course it was the dumb Butler. I knew that the whole time. The help cannot be trusted.",

            "Intro": " I'm glad you could make it to the dinner after all, dear. Welcome back to our house, sweet house!",
            "It Was The Home": "There's only one explanation for this... we live in a house, and not a home, for a reason!",
            "You Are Right": "The Butler! Ohhh, the Homes will pay for setting him up to this!",
            "You Are Wrong": "Honey, I can't see a foot in front of me, and even i know that you're wrong. Have you betrayed our family for those awful Homes?!",

            "Intro":"Aunt Prudence was considered the black sheep of the family, until Harriet and Harrold had Wattson. Her drinking had made herself quiet very hated and she still get's in a drunken rage whenever the estate is mentioned and how it should have been hers. Maybe, just maybe she wants revenge",
