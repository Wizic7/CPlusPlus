About:
    Born into privilege but cast aside by his own kin, Wattson became the black sheep of the family, 
    an outcast whose ideas and pursuits clashed with the rigid expectations of Victorian propriety. 
    Some say he dabbles in unnatural sciences; others whisper of his fascination with the occult. 
    His defiance of tradition—whether through his intellect, his experiments, 
    or his sheer disregard for the family's wishes—has left him a pariah at best and a danger at worst.
