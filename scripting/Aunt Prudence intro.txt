About:
"Prudence" is hilariously ironic for an aunt who enjoys her liquor a little too much, and "Clutterbuck" is just the right mix of bumbling and old-timey charm.
Aunt Prue is the type to insist she’s “only had a sip” while dramatically knocking over a decanter, telling outrageous (and likely exaggerated) stories of her youth,
and swearing she once danced with Prince Albert—though no one believes her.

Intro:
Aunt Prudence was considered the black sheep of the family, until Harriet and Harrold had Wattson. Her drinking had made herself quiet very hated and she still get's 
in a drunken rage whenever the estate is mentioned and how it should have been hers. Maybe, just maybe she wants revenge


"It was the Homes": 
    "I tolllllllld you it was those dah dah hommmes........."
    "Hey Prudence, is your head on straight?" 
    "YEah you are..I mean... I am *hic* *hic*"


You are right:
    "Oh my goodness you hot stuff, I can't believe [CHARACTER] did it and only you could solve it"
    "Ooga Ooga"
    "Yes I will marry you *hic* :D"

You are wrong:
    Mad:
        "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LIED!!! YOU....YOU SICK MAN!!
        "Ooga Ooga"
        "I'm done! I'm leaving you and sending you back to your world (She knew all along and played it off)"
    Happy:
        "Well *hic*, not everyone is right, but I want us to kindle OUR fire"
        "Ooga Ooga"
        "Yes, take me away darling and make me your queen!"


General Dialogue:
    "*hic* Harriet, why do you get everything you wnat? I have to work SOOO hard to get ANYTHING around hereeeee"
    "You're drinking my Brandy and I'm quite fed up with your behavior my dear Prudence"
    "Don't call me "mY dEaR pRuDeNcE" *hic*"
