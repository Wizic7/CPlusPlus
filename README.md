## Reflections
What went well
* Running main menu, as well as building to about 80% completion
* Troubleshooting skills
* Writing the story and the scripts for characters

What didn't go well
* Working to completion: More R&D, better setup
* Lack of documentation: Decide better deadlines and assignments to the whole team instead of generic timelines
* Connecting to the external library: Using a different language that makes connecting to external libraries easier
